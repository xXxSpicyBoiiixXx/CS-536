This course is being taken in the Spring of 2021. I will be dumping my notes and other related items towards this course.

The course content can be found [here](http://cs.iit.edu/~cs536/) 

I will be utilizing this book, ["Verification of Sequential and Concurrent Programs (3rd edition)"](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781848827448), by Krzysztof R. Apt, Frank S. de Boer, and Ernst-RÃ¼diger Olderog. This is meant for a more theortical audience.
